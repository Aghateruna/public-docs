# Profile

A Profile is the entity in Talent Protocol that represents a builder's digital identity and reputation.

## Profile Types

## Profile Properties

Profiles contain several key properties that constitute a builder's identity:

### Basic Information

- `id`: Unique identifier for the profile
- `name`: The builder's name
- `display_name`: The displayed name that may differ from the primary name
- `bio`: A short biography or description
- `location`: Geographic location
- `image_url`: Profile picture URL

### Reputation Properties

- `human_checkmark`: Boolean indicating if the profile owner has been verified as human
- `onchain`: Boolean indicating if the profile has verified onchain presence
- `tags`: Array of skill or interest tags associated with the profile
- `calculating_score`: Boolean indicating if the profile's score is being recalculated

### Technical Properties

- `created_at`: Timestamp when the profile was created

## Profile Search

The API v2 provides advanced search capabilities for profiles based on:

- Identity information (names, ENS domains, usernames)
- Connected accounts (GitHub, wallet addresses, etc.)
- Human verification status
- Builder Score values and score credentials
- Tags and interests

See the [API Reference](/docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference-v2) for detailed examples of profile search queries.
