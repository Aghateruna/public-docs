# User

A User represents an individual that signed up on talentprotocol.com

A **User** represents an individual that signed up on talentprotocol.com to verify their reputation data and increase their [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score), by connecting multiple [**accounts**](/docs/protocol-concepts/account)**.**

An [**Account**](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) represents a connection with a third-party entity (e.g., Wallet Address, GitHub, X, LinkedIn) that feeds reputation data into Talent Protocol. Accounts can exist independently or be linked to a user.

## Key Attributes:

- Each user has a unique identifier (UUID) in the Talent database, ensuring every user is distinct.
- Users have a single profile URL aggregating data from all associated accounts.
  - `talentprotocol.com/UUID`
- A user can connect multiple [accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account), but an account can only be linked to one user at a time.
- A user aggregates reputation data from all its connected [accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) into a unified [Builder Score](/docs/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score).
- A user is be able to sign-in to the Talent Protocol App with any account that they connected.
- For now, only the Talent Protocol app can create, update or delete users from the database. Ecosystem apps can only read data.

## Types of Users:

- **User**: when we mention the term "user", we're referring to all individuals who signed up at talentprotocol.com, even if they havenâ€™t connected a wallet or other accounts yet.
- **Onchain User**: Users with a verified EVM address added to the onchain Talent Registry.
- **Verified User**: Users who have earned a [Human Checkmark](/docs/protocol-concepts/human-checkmark).
- **Paying User**: Users who have spent funds on Talent Protocol, via the app or smart contracts.
- **Private User**: Users hidden from the app and API outputs, but still present in the database.
