# Degen Score (coming soon)

Degen Score will be an independent scoring system that identifies and recognizes talent in trading, investing, and market participation. Unlike Builder Score which focuses on creating software, Creator Score can evaluate factors such as:

* Trading volume and frequency
* Portfolio diversification and management
* Risk assessment and market timing
* Participation in token launches and airdrops
* Liquidity provision and yield farming activities

Degen Score uses the same technical framework as other Talent Protocol scoring systems but with data points specifically relevant to active market participants and traders.
