## Builder Score Onchain

- An onchain snapshot of the Builder Score of a given Talent ID and wallet address.
- Contract: [https://basescan.org/address/0xBBFeDA7c4d8d9Df752542b03CdD715F790B32D0B](https://basescan.org/address/0xBBFeDA7c4d8d9Df752542b03CdD715F790B32D0B)
- Developers can query the Builder Score of all user via the Talent API, but also access the Builder Score of Builder+ members onchain, via a custom contract.
- **Example**: Base reads the onchain Builder Score smart contract to validate if a user has a Builder Score ≥ 50 in order to provide a discounted [Basename](https://www.base.org/names). This means that to qualify for a discount, user needs to have a Builder Score ≥ 50 and be a Builder+ member.
