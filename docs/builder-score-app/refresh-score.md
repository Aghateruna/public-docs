# Refresh Score

### Automatic Refresh / Scheduled Updates

Talent Protocol recalculates the Builder Score of all accounts automatically at least every 30 days.&#x20;

* There's an automation running every day, to recalculate the Builder Score of all the accounts that havenâ€™t been updated in the past 30 days.
* Talent Protocol also automatically recalculates the Builder Score of an account every time that account is viewed/loaded in the Builder Score App.

### Manual Refresh / On Demand Updates

Users can trigger a manual recalculation of their Builder Score by clicking the "Refresh Score" button, in the Builder Score App.

* Users can do this operation for free, once every 7 days. Meaning that, after clicking the button, they will need to wait for the 7-day cooldown period.
* Users can also pay to skip the cooldown period and refresh their Builder Score instantly.

* are able to refresh their score on demand, using the "Refresh Data" button,
