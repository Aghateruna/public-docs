# Badges

## What are Badges?

Badges are a visual output, in the Builder Score app, based on one or more Data Points.

Examples:

* "Followed on X by Jesse Pollak"
* "Hackathon Winner"
* "Developer DAO Member"

Besides being a visual representation in the app, badges can also be onchain representation of the achievement, if the user decides to mint it (as an onchain attestation).

## Features of Badges:

* Badges are not tied to any scores or points; their value lies entirely in representing status and belonging.
* Badges are binary: a user either owns them or doesn’t—there are no levels or variable values.
* Badges are permanent: once earned, they cannot be revoked or lost.
* Badges can have a count, example: “Hackathon Winner x3”

Badges are still an experimental app-level concept, not a protocol-level primitive.
