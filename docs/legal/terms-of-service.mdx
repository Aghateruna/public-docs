4.3. Each Party’s obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire five (5) years from the date first disclosed to the Receiving Party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.

4.4. The terms and conditions of any negotiated agreement or pricing proposal will constitute Confidential Information of each Party but may be disclosed on a confidential basis to a Party’s advisors, attorneys, actual or potential acquirers, investors, or other sources of funding (and their respective advisors and attorneys) for due diligence purposes.
