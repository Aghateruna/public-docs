Terms and Conditions for the Builder Rewards program sponsored by Base, and operated by Talent Protocol.

Last Updated: June 3, 2025

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your participation in the Builder Rewards program ("Program"), sponsored by Base (Coinbase Technologies, Inc.) and powered by Talent Protocol (Reputation DAO LLC).

By participating in the Program, you (i) agree to be bound by these Terms and (ii) represent and warrant you meet all eligibility requirements. Failure to comply with these Terms or meet all eligibility requirements will result in your disqualification of the Program.

## 1. Program Overview

The Program automatically distributes rewards to eligible builders in the Base ecosystem based on their verified onchain and open-source contributions. The Program will distribute 2 ETH weekly beginning on March 31, 2025.

## 2. Eligibility

To be eligible for the Program, you must:

a) Have a Basename (your onchain identity on Base);

b) Have a Builder Score of at least 40;

c) Have earned a Human Checkmark verification on Talent Protocol;

d) Not have a wallet address on the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list;

e) Not be the target of any applicable sanctions laws or owned or controlled by someone that is the subject of sanctions laws, including those enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. Department of Commerce; and

f) Be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including all applicable anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing rules and regulations.

## 3. Program Period

The Program begins on March 31, 2025. Weekly rewards reset every Monday at 12pm UTC.

## 4. Reward Structure

Weekly rewards are distributed across three tiers:

a) Tier 1: Top 10 builders share 50% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.

b) Tier 2: Next 25 builders share 25% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.

c) Tier 3: Next 65 builders share 25% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

Your weekly ranking and rewards are determined by three separate factors:

a) Your Builder Score

b) Verified contributions to public crypto repositories on that week

c) Activity on verified contracts you've deployed on Base on that week

The specific weights and formulas used to calculate rankings are proprietary and subject to change at the sole discretion of Talent Protocol.

## 6. Reward Distribution

Rewards are distributed automatically to eligible participants. No application or claim process is required. You must maintain a valid Basename and ETH address for reward distribution. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria at the time of reward distribution, you will forfeit your right to the reward. Earned rewards cannot be carried over to subsequent weeks. All rewards are distributed in ETH.

## 7. Taxes

Recipients are solely responsible for any taxes associated with rewards received through the Program. Neither Base nor Talent Protocol will withhold any taxes or provide tax advice. Recipients should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax implications of receiving rewards.

## 8. Compliance Measures

For compliance with applicable sanctions regulations:

a) Automatic OFAC screening will be performed on all wallet addresses associated with Program participants;

b) The Human Checkmark verification process helps ensure participants are real individuals, not automated programs or fraudulent accounts;

c) Program administrators reserve the right to request additional verification if deemed necessary for compliance purposes before any reward distribution.

## 9. Prohibited Activities

The following activities are strictly prohibited:

a) Creating multiple accounts to increase chances of receiving rewards;

b) Using automated tools, bots, or other technical measures to artificially inflate activity metrics;
