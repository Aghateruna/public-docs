# Talent Protocol Public Docs

## How to Update Docs

1. Generate the auto-generated documentation files:
   1. `npm run generate-docs`
2. Do your changes inside the `docs` folder
   1. **Important** The autogenerated files are git ignored. **DO NOT EDIT THEM**. Your changes will not be taken into account.
      1. `docs/data-points/*.mdx`. Except from the **index.mdx**, if it is present.
      2. `docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference-v1/*.mdx`. Except from the **index.mdx**, if it is present.
      3. `docs/developers/talent-api/api-reference-v2/*.mdx`. Except from the **index.mdx**, if it is present.
3. Inspect locally by running `npm run start`. While you continue making changes to the pages your local browser will reflect these changes immediately.
4. If you are ready, it's good to try `npm build` to see whether documentation site is built successfully locally.
5. If `npm build` succeeds, try `npm run serve` to see how documentation site is served from the `build` folder.
6. As soon as you are happy, commit and create a PR.
7. Make sure that PR action builds successfully.
8. Merge the PR. As soon as you merge, online documentation will be updated automatically, thanks to the corresponding GitHub Actions Workflow.
